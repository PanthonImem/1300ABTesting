    <h1 class = text>  Responsive Redesign: MDCU Library </h1> 
    <i class = text> This webpage is an assignment for my class CSCI1300: UI/UX at Brown University. </i>
    </div>
    <div class = paragraph>
      <text class = text>
        For this assignment, I will be picking a website with some problems and propose a design that fixes those problem.
      </text>

      <text class = text>
        The website we'll be looking at today is linked down below. 
      </text>

      <a href="http://library.md.chula.ac.th/">  Library Website of Medical Department, Chulalongkorn University</a>

      <text class = text>
        The website looks like this.
      </text>

      <img src="images/general.png" width= "100%" height= "auto">

      <text class = text>
        This is a real and functional website although we can clearly see already that 
        there is much work to be done to clean up this website. 
        I got this website from my sister, who is a frequent user of the site when I asked her to 
        suggest a bad site UI-UX-wise.  
      </text>

      <text class = text>
        Please understand that there are over 150 links and 30++ photos in this website so I will not be able
        to replicate this site completely. In the spirit of responsive redesign, I will keep all the main components 
        but will only include 3 example links for each component out of 20++ as seen in the real site. 
      </text>

      <text class = text>
        Another point to note is that despite looking like this, this website is actually updated almost 
        daily by a team of ~20 librarians, and so the components on the page on your date of access may differ 
        than the screenshot here a bit, but the overall should look the same. 
      </text>
    </div>

    <div class = paragraph>
      <h2 class = text> What's the Usability Problem with this site</h2>
      <text class = text>
       Here I will show the many problems that make this site hard to use. 
      </text>

      <b class = text> 1. Lack of website structure</b>
      <text class = text>
        The structure of this site isn't very clear. We can notice that it is roughly divided into 
        2 parts: Top and Bottom. The top holds announcements, search bar, contact info, and also login panel. 
        The bottom contains 4 columns of resources and miscellaneous guides. The problem here is that the structure 
        isn't very clear and there is no good way to identify where the item the user is looking for is located on the page.
       </text>

       <img src="images/general.png" width= "100%" height= "auto">

       <b class = text> 2. Very clutterd</b>
      <text class = text>
        There are so many information on this page. Same as the lack of structure, this makes
        looking for something on this page very hard.
       </text>

       <b class = text> 3. Unclear Image Link </b>
       <text class = text>
         Some of the images on the site are links, others are not. There is no way to tell which one is a link and which one is not. 
        </text>
        <div>
        <img src="images/imgnotlink.png" class = myimg>
        <img src="images/imgislink.png" class = myimg>
        </div>

        <b class = text> 4. Lack of visual style </b>
        <text class = text>
          While overall, this website is following some universal style like underlining and coloring links blue,
          there exists many outliers where the the color used simply did not make any sense. See this image below.
          It is unclear what the purpose of using the color green and orange here is.
         </text>
        
         <img src="images/randomcolor.png" width= "80%" height= "auto">

         <b class = text> 5. No Responsiveness </b>
        <text class = text>
         The website is not responsive at all. Here is how it looks on a phone screen.
         </text>
         <img src="images/iphone.png" width= "327" height= "auto">
         <text class = text>
          We can see that this is pretty much unreadable and hence unusable. 
          </text>

          <b class = text> 6. Not very accessible as evaluated by WAVE</b>
        <text class = text>
        Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool WAVE by WebAIM suggests that there are 53 errors, 21 contrast errors,
        and 42 alerts. Upon manual review, a lot of these are problems on the coding side(e.g. missing description text)
        but nevertheless we will aim to satisfy WAVE as much as possible in our redesign.

      <h2 class = text>Prototyping the Fix: Low-fi Prototypes</h2>
      <text class = text>
        It is clear that almost every aspect of this website can be improved, but due to time limit, I will
        places a major emphasis on the biggest problem this site has: lack of structure. 
      </text>

      <text class = text>
        To struturize this site, we must first group similar components together.
        I found that most components fall under the following categories
      </text>
      <text class = text>
        <ol>
          <li> Web Title, Logo, and Contact Info</li>
          <li> Announcement </li>
          <li> Secure Area Login </li>
          <li> Search Bar </li>
          <li> Resources </li>
        </ol>
        Now we continue to building our low-fi prototypes.
      </text>
      <h2>The Low-fi Prototypes</h2>
      <img src="images/lofi1.png" style = 'width:70%'>
      <img src="images/lofi2.png" style = 'width:70%'>
      <img src="images/lofi3.png" style = 'width:70%'>

      <h2>Lo-fi: How this Fixes our Problems</h2>
      <text class = text>
      I will go through our listed problem one by one and explain how I fix this website
      <ol>
        <li> <b>Lack of structure</b> <br> 
        The redesigned web is partitioned into clear region.
        The placement of search bar, login panel etc. tries to mimic
        the placement of other website on the internet so that users can find them easily. 
        Elements from previous sites are also organized into hierarchy so that users can find 
        any element much easier.
        </li>
        <li> <b>Clutterness</b> <br> 
        How do we keep many information without overwhelming visitors?<br>
        By organizing information into hierarchy and hiding the specifics at first!<br>
        This is done through using collapsible panels and drop-down menu, so users can still 
        access any element by clicking on the related option but not overwhelmed by hundreds of other elements. 
        </li>

        <li> <b>Unclear Image Link </b> <br> 
          This is handled by the reorganization of any announcement-related elements into the 
          announcement <b>slideshow</b>. The image is also a link to related announcement and 
          the raised border help makes it clearer. 
        </li>

        <li> <b>Lack of visual style </b> <br> 
        This is handled by introducing clear color scheme blue(lightblue, lightcyan)/grey(#333) tone
        and reusing existing elements like dropdown/collapsible panels.
        </li>

        <li> <b>No Responsiveness </b> <br> 
          This is handled by using flex-box in implementation! The size of 
          almost every single element in the website is also made to be in relative units,
          so no matter how big your screen is the website will look okay on your screen.
          For smaller screens like Ipad/Phone, a CSS-condition is also applied to make 
          the size of everything scale better!
        </li>
        <li> <b> Bonus: Mobile Design </b> <br> 
          The relatively enlarged buttons and font on mobile is intentional. The users of this site 
          are doctors, many of whom are old and has presbyopia(long-sighted-ness), and so it is necessary 
          that all elements here are relatively large. This is less true for Ipad and larger screens. 
        </li>

      </ol>
      </text>
    </div>
    <div class = paragraph>
      <h2>Hi-fi: The Redesign</h2>
      <text class = text>
        The Redesign looks like this:
      </text>
      Laptop
      <img src="images/hifi1.png" class = myimg3 style = 'width:70%'>
      Ipad
      <img src="images/hifi2.png" class = myimg3 style = 'width:35%'>
      Phone
      <img src="images/hifi3.png" class = myimg3 style = 'width:20%'>
      <text class = text>
        Here's with annotation
      </text>
      <img src="images/hifiannot1.png" class = myimg3 style = 'width:80%'>
      <img src="images/hifiannot2.png" class = myimg3 style = 'width:80%'>
      <img src="images/hifiannot3.png" class = myimg3 style = 'width:80%'>

      <text class = text>
        The overall structure is straightforwardly containers stacking vertically 
        inside a flex-box. Some of the containers might have horizontal alignment for 
        wider screen but should shift to vertical alignment on smaller screens to get more space.

        Drop-down menu, slideshow, and expansible/collapsible panel should toggle on click.

      <text class = text>
        Below is the style guide for this site:
      </text>
      <img src="images/styleguide.png" style = 'width:70%'>
    </div>

    <div class = paragraph>
      <text class = text>
      <h2 class = text style = 'padding-bottom: 10px'>Final Webpage</h2>
        Below is the style guide for this site:
      </text>
      <a href="https://agile-plains-75457.herokuapp.com/" imageanchor="1">
        Here is the final MDCU Library Webpage<br>
      </a>
      <img src="images/finalweb.png" style = 'width:70%'>
      <text class = text>
       <b>Observation</b>
        <ul>
          <li> On laptop, the site looks much cleaner than the original.</li>
          <li> On Ipad, the menu bar became a bit broken but the overall site is still very much usable </li>
          <li> On Iphone, it could be argued that the linear structure and enlarged buttons are not very pretty, but overall the usability remains.
            The focus here is that users, many of whom are senile, can interact with this site and so the large 
          scale is necessary. </li>
          <li> The site looks fine for most screen-size in between</li>
        </ul>
      </text>
    </div>
    <div class = paragraph>
      <h3> Conclusion</h3>
      <text class = text>
        There is so much to be improved on this site, but due to my inexperience with 
        design tools and website development, this is the most I could complete using all late days.
        <br>
        Nevertheless, I think the bane of the original design is the lack of structure. 
        In this case, the solution is to introduce structure, which is the focus of my redesign.
