    <h1 class = text>  ABTesting: Which Cactus Shop Design Should We Use? </h1> 
    <i class = text> This webpage is an assignment for my class CSCI1300: UI/UX at Brown University. </i>

    <div class = paragraph>
      <text class = text>
        For this assignment, I will be editing a (fake) cactus selling website into two version, and then use statistics
        to analyze business metrics like return rate and time-to-complete-task to identify if the new version is better.

      <text class = text>
        The cactus shop website we'll be looking at today is linked down below. 
      </text>

      <a href="https://murmuring-ocean-06253.herokuapp.com/">  My CACTUS SHOP Website</a>

      <text class = text>
        There are two versions of the site.
      </text>

      <text class = text>
       <b> Version A</b>
      </text>
      <img src="images/sitevA.png" width= "100%" height= "auto">
      <text class = text>
        <b> Version B </b>
      </text>
      <img src="images/sitevB.png" width= "100%" height= "auto">
      

      <text class = text>
        In version A, which is the original site, there is a lot of space on the right.
        So in version B, I keep the same style but center most components and change the shopping cart color from red to a 
        friendlier blue. In the next section I will discuss the hypothesis about these changes.

    </div>

    <div class = paragraph>
      <h2 class = text> Hypotheses</h2>
      <text class = text>
       For this fake cactus shop, we care about two metrics:
       <ol>
         <li> Return Rate: The fraction of users who return to the shop after completing purchase/li>
         <li> Time-to-complete-task: The amount of time between user's page load time and last action</li>
        </ol>
      </text>

      <text class = text>
        <b> Return Rate Hypotheses</b>
      </text>
      <div class = subparagraph>
        <text class = text>
          <b>Null Hypothesis:</b> There is no statistically significant difference in the return rate of version A and version B. <br>
          <b>Alternative Hypothesis:</b> Version A has higher return rate than version B. 
        </text>

        <text class = text>
          <b> Return Rate Hypotheses Explanation</b>
          The alternative hypothesis suggests that version A has higher return rate than version B because some users,
          especially those taking this class, might be curious to see what version B looks like and hence the expected higher return rate.
          (I know that this is not related to our cactus business but it's the truth...)
        </text>
      </div>
      <text class = text>
        <b> Time-to-complete-task Hypotheses</b>
      </text>
      <div class = subparagraph>
        <text class = text>
          <b>Null Hypothesis:</b> There is no statistically significant difference in the time-to-complete-task of version A and version B. <br>
          <b>Alternative Hypothesis:</b> Version B has, on average, less time-to-complete-task than version A.
        </text>

        <text class = text>
          <b> Return Rate Hypotheses Explanation</b>
          The alternative hypothesis suggests that version B has lower time-to-complete-task than version B because the elements
          of the page is more centered. Most people keep their cursor near the center of the page and so it should be faster to click
          on version B.

      <h2 class = text style = 'padding: 0 0 0px; margin = 10px;'>Data Collection</h2>
      <text class = text>
      Unfortunately, some of the data are loss before the heroku 1500 latest log is discovered, and so part of the log 
      is lost forever. The log used in calculation is concatenated from several smaller logs obtained at different time.

      Most of the testing users are from cs1300 lab or piazza post, and so they are aware that there exists different versions of the interface.

      All data cleaning and calculation is done in python using Numpy and Pandas. <br>

      <h2 class = text style = 'padding-bottom: 10px'>Result and Analysis</h2>
        The following infographic shows our result.
      </text>

      <img src="images/info1.png" style = 'width:70%'>
      <img src="images/info2.png" style = 'width:70%'>
      <img src="images/info3.png" style = 'width:70%'>
      <img src="images/info4.png" style = 'width:70%'>

      <text class = text>
       <b>Observation</b>
        <ul>
          <li> On laptop, the site looks much cleaner than the original.</li>
          <li> On Ipad, the menu bar became a bit broken but the overall site is still very much usable </li>
          <li> On Iphone, it could be argued that the linear structure and enlarged buttons are not very pretty, but overall the usability remains.
            The focus here is that users, many of whom are senile, can interact with this site and so the large 
          scale is necessary. </li>
          <li> The site looks fine for most screen-size in between</li>
        </ul>
      </text>
    </div>
    <div class = paragraph>
      <h3> Conclusion</h3>
      <text class = text>
        There is so much to be improved on this site, but due to my inexperience with 
        design tools and website development, this is the most I could complete using all late days.
        <br>
        Nevertheless, I think the bane of the original design is the lack of structure. 
        In this case, the solution is to introduce structure, which is the focus of my redesign.
